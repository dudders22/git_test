        Despite looking awful..well to be fair it <em><strong>was</strong></em> fairly awful. I think this was mainly my fault
        as I cooked it badly. Was really watery broth, I didn't grind the pepper. It was
        a fairly delicate (watery) flavour, but I'm assuming it wasn't meant to be.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2Kg Beef</li>
        <li>Marrow Bones</li>
        <li>3 Carrots</li>
        <li>3 Turnips</li>
        <li>1 Celeriac</li>
        <li>1 Large Onion</li>
        <li>10 Whole Peppercorns</li>
        <li>10 Whole All Spice</li>
        <li>10 Whole Juniper Berries</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop up the veggies (not the onion) into 'rustic' chunks</li>
        <li>Put the Bones and meat into a pot, add 5 litres of boiling water, and blanch the shit out of them!</li>
        <li>Cut the onion in half, and dry fry! Should be borderline burned, not completely black</li>
        <li>Remove the scum from the Bones/Meat, and add the onion and spices. Do not add the salt for some reason. God forbid any flavour in this dish</li>
        <li>Simmer for an hour</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the veggies, and simmer for a further 45 mins.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is cooked, remove and let it rest. Remove veggies, sieve the liquid, then re-add the veggies. Serve the soup and meat separately, with some potatoes or some carby veg. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Verdict!</h4>
    <p>I think I very likely butchered a classic national dish, but the way I cooked it was awful. Not inedible but not good. 3/10</p>

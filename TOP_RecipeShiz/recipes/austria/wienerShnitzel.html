        Now we're talking. I'd not had home made Schnitzel prior to making this and it's definitely the 'schnit' <em>(ugh..I know)</em>
        I didn't have veal but went with Chicken, but this was just amazing with a squeeze of lemon and some coleslaw.

    <h6>Ingredients</h6>
    <p>
        <em>
            Note - measurements on these are vague - you'll need enough egg/flour/breadcrumbs to coat 
            the chicken but I've not managed to figure out how much that is. Buy plenty, and then 
            whatever you don't use can be used next time!

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Cutlets</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Oil (Any type)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Lemon for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Instructions</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken cutlets on a hard surface and cover with cling film. Smash it with a meat hammer, needs to be under 1cm thickness - slice breasts in 2 if easier!</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs, then make sure the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs are in bowls ready to dip the cutlets!</li>
        <li>Dip the cutlets in Flour > Egg > Breadcrumbs in that order.</li>
        <li>Heat lots of oil (at least 1/4 inch) in a large pan until it’s starting to smoke.</li>
        <li>Cook the shnitzel for 3 mins on one side. Make sure they don’t stick to the pan</li>
        <li>Turn and cook for 3 mins on the other side. Both sides need to be golden brown, internal meat temp of 63 degrees</li>
    </ol>
    <h6>Verdict</h6>
    <p>These are maybe the perfect fast food treat, they're so good. 9/10</p>

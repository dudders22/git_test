        <h1>Why I Play the Blues</h1>
        <p>People ask, <em>Fernando, do you need to play the <strong>blues?</strong></em></p>
        <p>Damn straight I do bitch. I've had a hard life, with several fictional struggles
        My wife left me, my dog's got a limp, and my car broke down. What the fuck you think I'm gonna be playing boy.
        This is enough for my first test Paragraph</p>
        <p>So yeah, I coulda hit the bottle. I could have cried to my Momma. But instead I play the blues
            like you wouldn't believe.</p>
